A trigger-happy policeman attached to the Bayelsa Police Command in the early hours today allegedly shot dead his colleague following an argument over N20,000, largess from an illegal duty. The duo went on an operation where they were rewarded with N20,000. According to a family source, the deceased was of the opinion that they should make returns to the Divisional Police Officer, DPO, while the other objected. While the argument ensued, the enraged police officer allegedly brought out his gun and shot dead his colleague who hailed from Ondewari community in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa. The body of the deceased, a married man with two wives, has been deposited at the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa morgue. A steady stream of sympathizers has been trooping in to pay their condolence to an officer many described as a jolly good fellow at the deceased’s residence at Swali, Yenagoa. When contacted, spokesman of the Bayelsa Police Command, Asinim Butswat, who could not confirm the incident said he was yet to be briefed on the matter.
