A driver was, on Monday, shot dead as suspected robbers made away with N5 million in Warri, Delta State. The driver, Chidobe (other name withheld), reportedly worked with a company, Smu-Tuns House Nigeria Limited, said to be owned by a marine business mogul based in Warri. Metro gathered that the incident happened around 9.45 a. m. when the driver and the manager of Smu-Tuns House went to a new generation bank on Airport Road near St. Mary’s junction, to withdraw money meant for workers’ salaries. Sources said the driver and the manager, who were driving in a Mercedes Benz (e-class), had noticed that a vehicle was on their trail from the bank. “They, therefore, decided to navigate through the Ajamimogha link Road to Mabiaku Road, but a commercial tricycle suddenly crossed their car and the robbers quickly shot at the tyres of the vehicle. “Amid the confusion, the driver, Chidobe, allegedly lost control of the vehicle, veered off the road and rammed into the fence of the Ecclesiastical Province of the Anglican Communion complex, near the “A” Division Police Headquarters in Warri,” the source disclosed. The bandits were said to have rushed out of their waiting car, shot at the driver, blasted the boot of the car with the gun and made away with the bag containing N5 million. The manager was, however, lucky as he reportedly escaped through the broken fence of the church. The Divisional Police Officer of “A” Division, CSP Kevin Zuokumor, declined comments on the incident. A senior police source, however, described the incident as “unfortunate,” noting that the police were already investigating the robbery, while remains of the driver had been deposited at the morgue of the Central Hospital Morgue, Warri, Delta State.
