Please doctor. Kindly tell me the cause of boils in one’s private part. Chika (by SMS)  Vaginal boils can happen a number of ways. Generally when a staph bacteria travels down a hair follicle and infects the pour is the most typical cause of any boil outbreak. However those that shave their genital regions can also have a high chance of contracting a vaginal boil. This is because an ingrown hair can become infected, or the infection can come from using a dirty public toilet. This is why washing your hands is so important, because you can come in contact with staph bacteria with your hands and spread that bacteria to other places on the body. Good hygiene is the best way to protect yourself from these unseen and sometimes invisible risks for boil outbreaks.  It is also a good idea to check your Fasting Blood Sugar in order to rule out the possibilities of diabetes which can also show as boils. A swab of the contents of the boil should be done for laboratory test in order to determine the correct antibiotics to use.
