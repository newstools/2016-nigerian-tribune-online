CHAIRMAN of Tricycle Union  in Cross River State, Dr. Joseph Ewa Effiom, has applauded the ongoing biometric exercise carried out by the Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIO) for tricycle operators in the state, saying it has contributed immensely to the reduction of crime in the state. Effiom who stated this in an exclusive chat with the Nigerian Tribune in Calabar was reacting to the allegations of the use of tricycle for criminal activities. He said; “When the biometric image capturing was being introduced by the State Vehicle Inspection Office VIO, we thought it was an avenue by the VIO to witch-hunt the operators of the industry and extort money from us, little did we know that the exercise was going to yield better fruits. ‘’ As we speak the crime rate through the use of tricycles has reduced because we can now identify each operator through the data they supplied during the image capturing. This is a good development” The state tricycle chairman stated that with the operator’s image captured and stored in a data bank, reported cases of theft through the use of tricycles have drastically reduced. He said any operator who indulges in snatching of passenger’s valuables can now be fished out through the biometric registration code stored in the data bank. ‘’ With the registration, cases of operators absconding with passengers luggages has reduced compared to those days when there was nothing like biometric image capturing.
